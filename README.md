# Simple Recipe App

Welcome to my — **Simple Recipe App**!  
This iOS application was built as a learning experience to explore the foundations of mobile development using SwiftUI.

Through this project, I learned how to:
- Build dynamic user interfaces using SwiftUI
- Navigate between views using `NavigationView` and `NavigationLink`
- Work with layout components like `VStack`, `HStack`, `ZStack`, and `ScrollView`
- Create custom data models and sample datasets
- Run and test apps in the Xcode iOS Simulator

## Project Description

Simple Recipe App is a mobile application that displays a list of recipes.  
When a recipe is selected, the app shows detailed information, including:

- Ingredients  
- Instructions  
- Number of servings  
- Preparation time  
- Cook time  

All within a clean, user-friendly layout.

This project helped me understand the core structure of SwiftUI apps and how views work together with data.
